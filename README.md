# Higher-Lower-Game
Small python game inspired by the popular online game "Higher Lower"

This game is built with Python and making it required basic knowledge of the fundamentals of the Python language:
variables, control flow, lists, dictionaries, functions and scope.

In order to run this gae, one must have the 3 files locally in the same directory and run the file "main.py" and make sure that the function "game()" is called.

The game will  at randomly take two entries from a list and will ask the user which entry (mostly superstars or big names on social media) does he/she thinks that has the most followers.

If the user's guess is right, a new entry will be picked and one of the previous entries (the one the correctly thought had less followers) will be kept. 

The game will then ask again which of these two entries, he/she thinks hsa the most followers.

As the user makes correct guesses, the user's score will increase and will be displayed.

If the user makes a wrong guess, the game stops and the user loses. The user's final score is then displayed.
